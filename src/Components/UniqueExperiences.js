      <p>
        The earth trembles beneath millions of wildebeest as they rush across the plains in search of food and safety. Watching the Great Migration is like witnessing a dramatic, real-life documentary where nature’s raw beauty and power take center stage.

        Start your day with a truly unique experience at Giraffe Manor in Nairobi, one of the most iconic boutique hotels in the world. Set in 12 acres of lush greenery, Giraffe Manor is home to a herd of endangered Rothschild giraffes who are free to roam the grounds. At breakfast, these gentle giants will join you, poking their long necks through the windows and over the tables to share in your meal—a magical start to your day in Kenya.
